**Titanic Survival Prediction Model using Decision Tree**

1. **Overview:**
   
   This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Decision Tree algorithm. The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, sex, class, and fare. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these attributes.

2. **Files:**

   - `titanic_decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
   - `titanic.csv`: Dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic.
   - `README.md`: This document providing an overview of the project.
   
3. **Dependencies:**

   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Scikit-learn
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn

4. **Usage:**

   To run the code, follow these steps:
   
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure you have all dependencies installed (recommended to use Anaconda or virtual environment).
   - Open `titanic_decision_tree.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the Decision Tree model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
   - Feel free to modify the code or parameters to experiment with different approaches.

5. **Dataset:**

   The dataset used in this project (`titanic.csv`) contains the following columns:
   
   - PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
   - Survived: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
   - Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
   - Name: Passenger's name.
   - Sex: Passenger's gender.
   - Age: Passenger's age.
   - SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
   - Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
   - Ticket: Ticket number.
   - Fare: Ticket fare.
   - Cabin: Cabin number.
   - Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

6. **Model Performance:**

   The performance of the Decision Tree model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualization techniques such as confusion matrix and ROC curve are employed to assess the model's performance.

7. **Future Improvements:**

   - Experiment with different machine learning algorithms to see if better performance can be achieved.
   - Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model accuracy.
   - Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the parameters of the Decision Tree algorithm for better performance.
   - Ensemble methods: Explore ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to enhance predictive accuracy.
